# Sneaker Database

## Getting Started
### Set-up API url
To run the application we need [Sneaks-API](https://github.com/druv5319/Sneaks-API) up and running.
 - Base URL can be set as `SNEAKER_API_BASE_URL` in `utils/vars.txt`, or in the environment as `API_BASE`.

### Run application
 - Install dependencies with `pip3 install -r requirements`.
 - To run development server, `python3 main.py` or `py main.py` in windows.

For production server, refer to [Flask Documentation](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/tutorial/deploy/)
